							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="../images/projects/AI%20Intern/" alt="" /></span> -->
							<div style=>
								<p>My first internship was with DriveTime where I joined the Cyber Security team at the corporate office. DriveTime sells used cars with financing options and has locations across America.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/projects/Cyber%20Security%20Intern/DriveTime%20Office.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The security team wanted a website. Other departments, like purchasing, had websites holding information and such for themselves so that anyone in the company could get the information they needed, so my project was to make this website for the Cyber Security team. Once I built the site (in Sharepoint), the team reported a 10% decrease in inquires! I uploaded all Cyber Security compliance documents and other paperwork to the site so that anyone could easily find and access it on their own. I also used python and Power BI to connect to REST API's from enterprise security software and display status dashboards. Let me explain.</p>
								<p>DriveTime purchases a number of security solutions to protect primarily its employees. These are the major ones:
									<ul><ul><ul>
										<li><a href="https://www.cylance.com/en-us/platform/products/index?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=PPC&utm_campaign=Bing_Search_Alpha_Brand_US&utm_content=%7bcreative%7d&utm_term=cylance%2520protect&sfc=70144000001EcbZ&_bt=71674465149880&_bm=e&msclkid=6f292599ca13150add7978f23c73d63f" target="_blank">Cylance Protect</a>: anti-virus</li>
										<li><a href="https://www.zscaler.com/" target="_blank">ZScaler</a>: web filtering, shows us how much Netflix you're watching.</li>
										<li><a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/product-family/email-protection" target="_blank">Proofpoint</a>: malicious email protection, the nigerian prince won't get through</li>
										<li><a href="https://www.alienvault.com/products/usm-anywhere" target="_blank">AlienVault</a>: threat detection across Office 365, AWS, Azure, and more</li>
										<li><a href="https://home.knowbe4.com/home" target="_blank">Knowbe4</a>: simulated phishing training, my favorite üòè</li>
									</ul></ul></ul>
								</p>
								<p>Each of those security solutions has a "threat dashboard" where it displays important stats in the last week like the number of threats it's found, emails blocked, or websites blocked. Logging in to each of those sites individually is tedious, so to make it more convenient I used python and Power BI to connect to their API's to display the same information on one page on the new website! This saved time for the Cyber Security team, and allowed them to be more informed.</p>
								
								<p>On my own accord, I included educational pages that informed people about phishing emails and secure passwords. I suggest everyone to use a password manager like <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a>, and check for hacked accounts at <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com" target="_blank">HaveIBeenPWNED</a>.</p>

								<p>The most fun I had was phishing the other 25 interns. üé£ Email phishing is a technique used by hackers. It's like spam email, but a more targeted attack. I made the test moderately difficult, and many of the interns failed! They went to a phony website to "update their password" when in reality their username and password was sent to the fake website (we didn't really collect them). After the test was over, I gave a presentation to everyone about phishing and how to identify a phishing email.</p>
								<ul class="actions">
									<li><a href="" class="button" target="_blank">Phishing Powerpoint</a></li>
								</ul>
								<p>Besides playing ping pong at lunch everyday, the other fun part of my time at DriveTime was learning about malware attacks like keyloggers and cross-site scripting. My boss let me install Kali Linux on my work PC where I learned how to create malware and test the anti-virus software (strictly testing purposesüòâ). </p>
